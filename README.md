 An azure resource group is a group collection of assets in groups for easy and automatic provisioning, monitoring, and access control. So, First step, select the specific subcription that you have purchased, in this instance we will be selecting "Azure Subcription 1" which will be the free subcription that we started off with in azure. Next, you want to make sure that selected the correct region which in this case we will be selecting "West US 3". Finally, we will be making a name for the resource group.. The name I will be using is "RGLab2" (as you see above).. Once we finish that you'll click "Review + Create" Next steps will be shown below...

Secondly, you want to make sure all your information is typed in correctly, make sure you selected the correct subcription, and also, most importantly you want to make sure that you selected the correct region. In this case, you may see the "add tag" option but its not necessary at this moment. After all that is done you will hit the "create" button and give the computer some time to review and create the group.

Finally, your group should be created and you can go back to your resource groups and view the group you just created, dont be afraid to test some things out like adding groups inside of your resource group. When you want to create another group you will click the "Create' that's circled above. Well, that's how you create a resource group, if you need any other explantion there will be a link above that goes more in depth.
